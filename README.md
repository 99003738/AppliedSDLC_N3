## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Running the make file as its resolved by defining its correct path(.out for linux and -lm for math functions)
2. Syncronizing the VS code to github , colleague help to resolve the issue
3. Making the function call in correct path
4. Open git log while committing, thus went to github desktop and pulled origin and then pushed origin.
5. Test case code for the boundary problem. Added code with the help of internet
6. Integration problem since lots of header file was there. Changes made in header file to remove the multiple occurance error.
