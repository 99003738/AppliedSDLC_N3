## Introduction
    
 Now days calculator is contributing in each and every one of us life, some of us using for very basic arithmetic calculation and some of using for calculating such a complex problem which take so many hours to calculate by manually. Hence in market there are various categories of calculator available based on your requirements. Some of them are made to be very specific in term of their using and some of them are used by different-different class of people who are using it. Like students, graduate students, business man, local shops and etc. If define this device in very short then we can say it is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponential operations, roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions. Internally, some calculators actually perform all of these functions by repeated processes of addition. Most calculators these days require electricity to operate. Portable, battery-powered calculators are popular with engineers and engineering students.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
*	10Th,11th,12Th Students can use basic and some additional features
*	Engineering Students can use more features like Graphical Evaluation
*	For Basic Calculations (ex Shopkeepers)


**TBD**

## What:
 *	We are building a calculator with having features of basic, scientific and graphical calculator.
 *	Providing mode Selector Switch for power Management.
 *	We are adding activity tracker feature.


**TBD**

## When:
*	Labs
*	Colleges
*	Examination hall
*	Shops


**TBD**

## Where:
*	To solve Mathematical equations [basics or complex]
*	Very Needful in colleges to solve equations like Trigonometric. Logarithms etc.â€¦
*	We can also use it for basic calculations where Shopkeeper can use for basic Calculations


**TBD**

## How:
*	Input:- Tiny plastic keys with rubber membrane underneath and touch sensitive circuit underneath
*	Processor: - A controller that does all the hard work
*	Output: -we are using LCD for Showing all the inputs and shows the results.
*	Power source: - A long life battery, using solar chargeable battery


**TBD**
